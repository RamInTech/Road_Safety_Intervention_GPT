      "IRC:67-2022 - Clause 14.6 states: \"Where the Authority considers it necessary, it shall take measures to reduce the risk of accidents, including the use of traffic calming devices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🛠️ Recommended Intervention\n",
      "Effective speed reduction measures include:\n",
      "1. Curve Approach Speed Reduction Signs\n",
      "2. Speed Limit 20/30 kmph Zones\n",
      "3. Traffic Calming Devices\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🧩 Why This Works\n",
      "These measures work by:\n",
      "- Curve Approach Speed Reduction Signs: Giving drivers advance warning to slow down\n",
      "- Speed Limit 20/30 kmph Zones: Reducing crash severity for children and vulnerable road users\n",
      "- Traffic Calming Devices: Forcing drivers to slow down\n",
      "\n",
      "### 📝 Step-by-Step Fix Guide\n",
      "1. Conduct a thorough analysis of high-risk spots and areas with frequent crashes\n",
      "2. Identify suitable locations for Curve Approach Speed Reduction Signs\n",
      "3. Install Speed Limit 20/30 kmph Zones in school opening and closing hours and dense urban corridors\n",
      "4. Deploy Traffic Calming Devices in areas with repeated pedestrian or side-impact crashes\n",
      "\n",
      "### 💰 Estimated Cost (if applicable)\n",
      "The cost of implementing these measures will depend on the specific location and type of devices used. However, a rough estimate for a typical Indian engineering rate would be:\n",
      "- Curve Approach Speed Reduction Signs: ₹10,000 - ₹50,000\n",
      "- Speed Limit 20/30 kmph Zones: ₹5,000 - ₹20,000\n",
      "- Traffic Calming Devices: ₹50,000 - ₹200,000\n",
      "\n",
      "### ⚠️ Compliance Check (if intent == compliance_check)\n",
      "Compliant\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Final Answer\n",
      "Effective speed reduction measures, including Curve Approach Speed Reduction Signs, Speed Limit 20/30 kmph Zones, and Traffic Calming Devices, can be implemented to reduce speeding-related crashes and improve road safety.\n"
